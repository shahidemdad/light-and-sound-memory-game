## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
>I used websites like w3schools.com to find different HTML colors and their color code to customize my website.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
>A challenged I encountered in creating this submission is the logic portion. Even though, the logic picture was giving me
a better understanding how to do it, I was still struggling to understand it and how to actually convereted that in code.
Therefore, first I did sudocode, I wrote down all the steps I needed to do to do the logic and then I tried to start looking
from a programming prespective and how can I convert them into code. Even though, the solution was there. I took my time to solve
it by myself and when I did. I felt really proud. My learning lesson from this challenge is not to rush through my code and not to
get to coding. I had to take a step back and figured out what I needed to do and what is the outcome I wanted. After realizing my
steps, it helped me to see through the steps pretty easily.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
>I was looking at those optional features to add. However, I was thinking an extra feature to add is to play for multiple persons.
I wonder if there could be a way where I can store those informations and have a highscore or even a timing of who can do it faster.
Those features looked fancy to me. If I get selected and learn more on HTML, CSS and Javascript. I will come back and add those
desire features I want to add.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
>If you had a few more hours to work on this project, I would spend learning more on Javascript logic portiona and learn
on how to store data and compare them and also store players information. I wished to do the optional features, however I did not
have enough knowledge to tackle that. Therefore, my extra hours would go for more on learning and implement those features.
